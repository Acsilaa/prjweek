            <h1>What is an AI?</h1>
            <p>An Artificial Intelligence (referred to as AI) is a <b>simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.</b></p>
        </main>
        <section>
            <h3>Where can I meet Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Long story short: everywhere, but nowhere.</p>
            <p>The more simple answer is for the <b>nowhere</b> part, since it can be explained as the following: there is no such thing as a real, fully functional artificial INTELLIGENCE (yet). Emphasis on the intelligence, since it is the ability to acquire and <b>apply</b> knowledge and skills. A computer can very well be trained to recognise a human walking, but hiding behind a cardboard box will break the whole program, since the computer can detect walking, but can't apply the knowledge to anything else. <b>It isn't intelligent.</b></p>
            <p>The AI term used today includes any task a computer can successfully complete, after a learning period. Basically "(self-) teaching" a computer. In this sense, AI surrounds us all the time. Think about our phone's Google Assistant or Siri. These two are self trained AIs, but the function we mainly use on them is the Chatbot feature, as if we were talking to a <b>real person</b>.</p>

            <p>The chatbot we are going to talk about is none other than the infamous <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, developed by <a href="https://openai.com" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>.</p>
